# Pong Fighter
The result of my dumb idea to try putting fighting game meter in Pong

Meter is gained passively over time, and from hitting balls back or scoring

You lose some meter when you are scored on

You can shoot out an extra ball for 1 bar, but you can't shoot a ball while the cooldown bar is active (red bar that shows up above your meter)

The cooldown bar activates after shooting or hitting a ball

You can also dash up or down for 1/2 a bar

Controls:

P1 - WS for up/down, Q to dash, D to shoot a ball

P2 - PL for up/down, { to dash, K to shoot

Thanks for trying out my game :)
